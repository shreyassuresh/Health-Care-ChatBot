# Health-Care-ChatBot
Health-Care Chatbot System

The Health-Care Chatbot System is an intelligent, user-friendly desktop application designed to assist users in identifying potential diseases based on their symptoms. Using machine learning techniques, a decision tree classifier is employed to predict possible diagnoses and provide suggestions for appropriate medical consultations.
## Key Features

### 1. Symptom-Based Diagnosis
- Users interact with the chatbot to answer questions about their symptoms.
- Dynamically predicts the most probable condition and provides detailed insights.

### 2. Doctor Consultation Recommendations
- Links potential diagnoses to relevant specialists.
- Provides hyperlinks to online resources or contact information for medical professionals.

### 3. Interactive User Interface
- User-friendly GUI built with Python's Tkinter library.
- Simple buttons for "Yes," "No," and clear options ensure seamless interaction.

### 4. User Account Management
- Secure login and registration systems for personalized user access.
- Data is stored locally, maintaining user privacy.

### 5. Machine Learning Integration
- Employs a Decision Tree algorithm to process the dataset and make predictions.
- Dimensionality reduction techniques optimize performance.
